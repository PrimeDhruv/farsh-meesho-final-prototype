/**
 * FUNNEL — views → clicks → orders, per price range.  (Oct 2026 upgrade; engine module M3b)
 * Pure, UI-free. Works on the simulated price buckets from data/demandBuckets.js, which carry for a typical
 * look-alike listing, per 30 days:  views, clicks (views × ctr) and orders (views × opv, opv = orders per view).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A Meesho seller watches views and clicks first, and it is a volume game: more people who see
 * and click the listing means more orders, and total profit (profit per order × orders) is what matters, not profit
 * per order alone. So Farsh answers "what happens to my views, clicks and orders if I move my price?".
 *
 * HOW A PRICE MOVE IS ESTIMATED ("as seen now"). The baseline is what the listing gets TODAY (its own last 30 days,
 * when it is live) or, for a product with no sales yet, what a typical look-alike gets at its price. Moving to a
 * different price range scales the baseline by how that range compares with the current one:
 *
 *      views  = baseline views  × (typical views in the new range ÷ typical views in the current range)
 *      ctr    = baseline ctr    × (new range ctr ÷ current range ctr)          clicks = views × ctr
 *      opv    = baseline opv    × (new range opv ÷ current range opv)          orders = views × opv
 *
 * So a price that sits where more buyers look and buy raises views, the click rate AND orders per view; a price
 * above the busy range does the opposite. These are estimates from simulated group data, never a promise, and the
 * floor always comes first: a price below the no-loss price is flagged as a loss however many views it would bring.
